# Getstartedwithdrones

An website where people can answer a lot of questions to find out what kind of drone fits them best.


### You want to help with this project??
- You can help with the questions system by downloading the `getstartedwithdrones.drawio` file and loading it in the draw.io website or app.
- In the futer I want to add a form to the website where users can add there drones, transmitters, goggles etc and all the info to the websites database so I can use that to help other users choose the best option.
